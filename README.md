# House_Price_Prediction
Introduction
This project focuses on building a web application to predict house prices 
1. Problem definition
We used a simple case study to understand the problem. 
The house buyer, a client that wants to buy their dream home. They have some locations in mind. Now, the client wants to know if the house price matches the value. With the application, they can understand which features are influence the final price. If the final price matches the value predicted by the application the can ensure they are getting a fair price.
User function
* Predict house price
Operating enviroment
* platform: Python
* Operating system: Windows
2. Gather data, analyze and build models
We started by loading data and packages we needed for the research.We then analyzed the data to understand the relationships between the price and other features. We cleaned the data and replaced some missing values. We then trained our model and started perfoming some predictions.
3. Results and discussions
Lasso is better
4. Conclusion
With the help of machine learning we can predict house price.
